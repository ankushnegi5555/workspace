## Useful plugins for VS Code:-
1. **Prettier-** Prettier doesn’t need much of an introduction. It’s an opinionated code formatter turned into an extension for VS Code. If you want to make your code prettier (pun unintended), you should consider installing this handy little extension.
2. **ESLint-** ESLint turns the most popular JavaScript linter into a VS Code extension. If you are using ESLint in your projects already, grab the extension and let it work.
3. **GitLens-** Blame, code authorship, activity heatmaps, recent changes and history are only some of the features it provides. If you are working on any repository with more than one contributor, this is something you should probably have.
4. **Live server-** Live Server provides you with an easy way to serve static and dynamic pages from VS Code, while it also supports live reloading.
5. **REST Client**- REST client might be one of the best extensions I have used in a while, as it allows you to send HTTP requests and view the responses directly in VS Code.
6. **Babel JavaScript-** It supports ES201x, React and JSX syntax highlighting, which I guess is something most people working with any kind of modern web application would like to have. It might not look like much initially, but it does make a difference in the long run.
7. **Fira Code-** Fira Code is one of the best programming fonts with ligatures that can help you scan code a lot faster once you get used to it.
8. **Quokka.js-** Quokka.js is a playground for JavaScript and TypeScript. It runs your code immediately as you type and displays various execution results in your code editor.
